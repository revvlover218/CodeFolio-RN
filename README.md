# Welcome to CodeFolio-RN

This is a portfolio demo app to describe a little bit about myself and the programming languages I have developed over my time in 
Information Technology.

It is also my first dive into the world of React Native. A platform agnostic langauge development platform.

It is also built using Expo.

## Get started

To get started with the project visit [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and
follow the setup guidelines to install all dependencies needed to be able to run an expo app including, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
and Expo Go.

## About the app

CodeFolio also includes the integration of libraries and APIs such as Expo-Router, Maps, Notifications. A great way to showcase some of the
powerful features of React Native.

Lastly, it also has dark mode capabilities!
